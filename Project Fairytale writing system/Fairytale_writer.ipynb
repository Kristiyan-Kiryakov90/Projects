    "\n",
    "This project develops a fairy-tale generation system by adapting a pretrained large language model to produce child bed time stories that follow a strict response format and satisfy user-specified constraints. The approach combines Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT) on a curated corpus of public-domain fairy-tales from Project Gutenberg to improve domain fluency and stylistic fidelity, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enforce consistent instruction following and output structure."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models can generate creative narratives; however, general-purpose instruction models frequently exhibit variability in adherence to structured output requirements and compliance with explicit constraints. In the context of children’s storytelling, such variability is problematic because users expect stable formatting, predictable tone, and safe, age-appropriate content. Furthermore, fairy-tale quality depends on domain-specific conventions that may not be reliably reproduced by a model trained broadly on heterogeneous text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, the project adopts a two-stage adaptation strategy. First, DAPT aligns the model’s language distribution more closely with the fairy-tale domain. Second, SFT (implemented with LoRA for parameter efficiency) teaches the model to transform structured user inputs into consistently formatted outputs, improving controllability without requiring full-parameter fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based on Qwen3-8B, a dense, decoder-only Transformer model from the Qwen3 family. It was chosen over other ~8B open weight models because it best matches the needs of a fairytale-writing system: it produces more natural storybook narration (strong creative/roleplay behavior), follows style and structure constraints more reliably (age level, moral, length, recurring phrases), supports longer contexts for better plot continuity, and is multilingual-friendly for writing/translation. On the practical side, its Apache-2.0 license is also easier for deployment and commercialization than more restrictive community/custom licenses, reducing legal and operational risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qwen3 models follow the standard GPT-style causal language modeling setup: given a sequence of tokens, the model predicts the next token autoregressively. In Transformers, the Qwen3 architecture is implemented as a stack of decoder blocks with modern efficiency upgrades such as RMSNorm, RoPE positional embeddings, SwiGLU feed-forward layers, and grouped-query attention (GQA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "- Superior human preference alignment, excelling in creative writing, role-playing, multi-turn dialogues, and instruction following, to deliver a more natural, engaging, and immersive conversational experience.\n",
    "- Support of 100+ languages and dialects with strong capabilities for multilingual instruction following and translation.\n",
    "- Smaller models in the ~2B range can be effective for short-form text or narrow tasks, but often struggle to maintain both creativity and coherence while also meeting multiple explicit constraints.\n",
    "- Context length - 32k tokens natively\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture:\n",
    "- **Token embedding layer** - It converts each token id into a dense vector. Embeddings let the model learn semantic relationships between tokens.\n",
    "- **RoPE (Rotary Position Embeddings)** - it injects position information directly into attention by rotating query/key vectors based  on token position. Helps the model understand word order and supports long-context behavior better than older absolute position embeddings.\n",
    "- **Transformer decoder blocks**\n",
    "  - RMSNorm (normalization) -Normalizes activations to keep training stable.\n",
    "  - Causal self-attention (with a causal mask) - Each token attends only to previous tokens (not future ones), enforcing autoregressive generation. It is the core mechanism that lets the model look back at context to decide the next token.\n",
    "  - GQA (Grouped-Query Attention) - Uses more query heads than key/value heads (shared KV across groups of queries). It reduces KV-cache memory and speeds inference\n",
    "  - Residual connection - Adds the block input back to the block output. This helps gradients flow during training and allows deep stacks to train reliably.\n",
    "  - Feed-Forward Network (MLP) with SwiGLU\n",
    "  - Final normalization + LM head - Final RMSNorm and a linear projection (LM head) convert hidden states into logits over the vocabulary. It produces the next-token probability distribution.\n",

    "Develop a fairy-tale generator that reliably produces high-quality, child-appropriate stories from structured user inputs while maintaining a stable and verifiable response format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Evaluation objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the final model’s narrative quality using an LLM-based judge with a structured rubric (craft/coherence and element integration), and compare the scores against stories sampled from the TinyStories dataset as a reference."

    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "###3.1 Data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "A public-domain English corpus is constructed from Project Gutenberg, selected to emphasize fairy-tale and folklore texts. For the SFT stage, the TinyStories dataset is used to teach instruction-following and constraint adherence in short, child-friendly stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "###3.2 Data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gutenberg dataset was cleaned from transcriber notes, duplicated sections, headers, footers.This step aims to maximize training signal quality by preserving story content while minimizing non-narrative noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TinyStories dataset was also filtered to keep only examples with a complete prompt structure (summary, features, and required words), excluding entries with missing elements\n",
    "\n",
    "###3.3 Token-safe chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Because books exceed the model’s training context window, texts are segmented into token-budgeted chunks. Chunking is performed at paragraph boundaries where possible to preserve semantic coherence and avoid splitting within words. A limited overlap between consecutive chunks is introduced to maintain local continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "###3.4 Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT)\n",
    "\n",
    "DAPT is used to adapt the model’s distribution toward fairy-tale language and narrative patterns before instruction tuning. While the base model is generally fluent, domain adaptation improves stylistic consistency and reduces generic, modern, or off-tone phrasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###3.5 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with LoRA\n",
    "SFT is applied to enforce controllability: structured prompting, consistent section formatting, and robust inclusion of user constraints. Because full-parameter fine-tuning of an 8B model is resource-intensive and increases overfitting risk, LoRA is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA freezes the base model and trains only small low-rank adapter parameters inserted into selected layers - attention and MLP projection matrices.\n"

    "## 4. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Narrative quality is evaluated with an LLM judge (GPT-5 mini) that assigns rubric scores to each story. GPT-5 mini is used because it can follow a fixed rubric reliably and return consistent numeric ratings at low overhead, which makes it practical to score many samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation follows the multi-axis grading approach described in the writing benchmark: stories are scored on craft & coherence questions and element-integration questions that check whether required constraints are used naturally, not just mentioned. These rubric dimensions are then combined into a single score using a 60/40 weighted power mean (Hölder mean, p = 0.5), which behaves like a soft-minimum so weaknesses pull the score down more than strengths can compensate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The judge also compares the final model’s generated stories against stories sampled from the TinyStories-style dataset, providing a reference point for whether the model’s outputs are comparable in clarity, coherence, and constraint use to the data distribution it learned from. To reduce bias, the same judge model and rubric are used for both sources, and stories are evaluated without revealing whether they are generated or dataset samples."

    "- One LoRA adapter for DAPT and SFT training is chosen. It keeps the parameter-efficient adaptation path consistent across stages and prevents additional confounding factors.\n",

    "- The maximum sequence length is set to 2048 tokens as a practical trade-off between modeling capacity and computational feasibility. This context window is sufficient to accommodate the system prompt, user constraints, and structured output while still leaving enough room for generating approximately 1000 tokens of story text. Increasing the lenght will, the model will consume more VRAM and the training will be slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-  The rank r = 16 to provide sufficient adaptation capacity for DAPT, which targets a genuine distribution shift toward fairy-tale style and content. If r is too small, the adapter may not have enough degrees of freedom to represent the necessary domain-specific changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The scaling factor α = 32 so that α/r equals 2, which constrains the update magnitude relative to the base weights and supports stable optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- LoRA is applied to both attention and feed-forward (MLP) projections because these components contribute differently to the model’s behavior. Adapting attention projections (q, k, v, o) modifies how the model retrieves and integrates contextual information, which is relevant for maintaining narrative coherence, tracking entities, and sustaining repeated motives. Adapting MLP projections (gate, up, down) modifies the transformation of internal representations and is closely tied to stylistic realization, lexical choice, and the overall narrative of the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A maximum generation budget of approximately 1000 new tokens is used to meet the requirement for long-form stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sampling with temperature 0.8 and top-p 0.9 provides a balance between diversity and coherence: it allows variation in narrative expression without excessively increasing the probability of incoherent or off-format outputs. Decreasing the temperature may cause repetition and reduce creativity. Reducing the top-p may reduce randomness and cause sudden shift in narratives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top_k sampling to the 50 most likely next tokens at each step. It keeps the model from picking very low-probability tokens, which often causes random, unrealistic events, while still leaving enough options to avoid bland, repetitive phrasing. With children’s stories, reducing top_k can sound stiff; increasing top_k can drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "- no_repeat_ngram blocks the model from repeating any exact 4-word sequence. Using 4 is a sweet spot: it stops obvious copy-paste phrasing without breaking natural repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- repetition_penalty slightly reduces the probability of tokens that have already appeared, nudging the model away from repeating the same words while not hurting coherence. If the penalty is increasing, the model starts avoiding necessary words and becomes unnatural. Value of 1.06 is the lowest that removes the repetition without degrading style.\n"

    "Many decoder-only models do not provide a dedicated padding token, but padding is required for batching, so the end-of-sequence token is reused as pad_token. During training, right padding is used because it aligns sequences in a way that is safer with packing and loss masking.

    "𝑁, which is expensive to compute and costs a lot of GPU memory. Flash Attention 2 avoids materializing that full matrix by computing attention in fused, GPU-optimized tiles and streaming intermediate results. This reduces memory traffic and peak VRAM usage, which usually translates into higher training throughput (more tokens per second) and fewer memory bottlenecks compared to normal attention—especially at longer context lengths.\n",

    "During training the key–value (KV) attention cache is disabled because it wastes GPU memory and can interfere with gradient checkpointing; training already processes full sequences with backprop, so caching past states provides no benefit. During inference the cache is enabled because generation happens token by token, and reusing the stored keys and values avoids recomputing attention over the whole prompt each step, making decoding much faster."

      "the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one\n",
      "of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\n",
      "gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his\n",
      "eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in\n",
      "the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was\n",
      "ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning\n",
      "another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but\n",
      "the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come\n",
      "to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself\n",
      "under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling\n",
      "noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as\n",
      "it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son\n",
      "jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;\n",
      "only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.\n",
      "The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the\n",
      "council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than\n",
      "all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no\n",
      "use to me, I must have the whole bird.’\n",
      "\n",

      "that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the\n",

      "there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you\n",
      "to be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can\n",
      "such a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at\n",
      "the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and\n",
      "ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to\n",
      "the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people\n",
      "singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,\n",
      "and poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby\n",
      "house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,\n",

    "- SFT updates are driven by supervised instruction targets. A lower learning rate than DAPT (5e-5) is used because SFT is intended to make a targeted behavioral adjustment—improving schema and constraint compliance—while preserving the broader domain adaptation learned during DAPT. Reducing the step size limits the magnitude of updates to the adapter and therefore lowers the risk of overwriting domain-specific stylistic knowledge, or memorizing scaffold phrasing instead of generalizing the structure. A high learning rate can make the model overfit those patterns quickly and drift in bad ways.\n",

      "Hansel and Gretl are walking in the dark forest. They are scared but they hold hands. \"Look,\" Hansel says, \"there's a small house with a big window.\" \"Let's go see it,\" Gretl says. She picks up a crumb and drops it on the ground. Hansel follows the crumb with his eyes. He sees more crumbs. He walks behind the crumb. It leads him to the door of the house. He knocks on the door. The door opens. A woman with a warm voice says, \"Welcome! You're very brave to come this far.\" She smiles. Hansel and Gertrude step inside. The room is full of things they like. There are toys, books, and food. The food looks good. It smells good too. Hansel goes to the kitchen. He sees a big oven. He wants to touch it. He reaches out. But then he hears a whisper. It says, \"Don't touch the oven, it's hot!\" Hansel jumps back. He tells Gretl about the whisper. She laughs. \"It's just the wind,\" she says. She goes to the oven and touches it. She feels it's warm. She thinks it's safe. She takes a piece of bread from the oven and eats it. Hansel watches her carefully. He doesn't want to be eaten either. He looks around for a way out. He sees an old lantern hanging from the ceiling. He climbs a chair and gets it. He turns it on. The light shows him a secret path. He runs down the path and calls to Gretl. \"Come quick! I found a way out!\" Gretl follows him. They run through the dark forest until they see their house. They hug each other and feel happy. They know they can always find their way with the help of the crumbs and the lantern.\n",

      "There was once a little girl called Little Red Riding Hood. She wore a red hood and had a big, round basket full of treats. One day she set off through the dark forest with the basket on her back.\n",
      "The path was winding and tangled but she kept walking until she arrived at her destination - a small cottage. It was the house of her grandma, who she loved very much.\n",
      "She knocked on the door and heard a growl coming from inside. She opened the door and there stood a giant wolf! He was so big and scary that Little Red was scared out of her wits. \n",
      "But the wolf wasn't interested in eating Little Red. Instead he wanted to know where she was going. So Little Red told him she was on her way to visit Grandma. The wolf smiled and said, \"I'll come too!\"\n",
      "Suddenly, Little Red was running as fast as she could down the path. The wolf was racing after her. Little Red knew she needed to get away from the wolf before it was too late.\n",
      "She ran as hard as she could and soon she was at Grandma's house. She called for help, but no one answered. Suddenly she saw a man walking towards her. He was wearing a long coat and had a gun in his hand.\n",
      "The man took aim and fired his gun at the wolf. The wolf fell to the ground and didn't move anymore. Little Red was safe again.\n",
      "Grandma came out and thanked the man for rescuing Little Red. She gave him some cookies and tea, then they all sat down for dinner. Little Red felt happy again and was glad she made it safely home.\n",
      "As the night grew darker, Little Red decided it was time to go home. She put on her red hood and picked up her basket. She waved goodbye to Grandma and left the cottage behind.\n",
      "As she walked along the path, she noticed something strange. The trees seemed to be growing taller and the path appeared to be getting narrower. Little Red frowned, unsure of what was happening.\n",
      "Then suddenly she heard a loud noise. She looked around and saw smoke rising from the path ahead. Little Red gasped in horror and quickly turned around, running as fast and as far as she could.\n",
      "The smoke was coming from the cottage. Little Red had just realized that the wolf had been lying to her! He hadn't gone home but had taken over Grandma's house!\n",
      "Just when it seemed like everything was lost, a loud voice shouted from behind her. It was Grandma! She had gone outside to investigate and found the wolf hiding in the bushes. She grabbed a stick and chased him away.\n",
      "Little Red was so relieved. She hugged Grandma tightly and thanked her for saving her life. They both agreed never to trust a stranger again.\n",

      "There was once a poor girl called Cinderella. She lived in a house filled with ash from the fireplace. Every day she had to sweep the ashes away. It was very hard work and Cinderella felt unhappy. \n",
      "One night, she found out that there was going to be a big party at the palace. All the rich people would be there. Cinderella wished she could go too, but she knew it wasn't possible.\n",
      "Suddenly, a small voice said \"Don't worry Cinderella! I'll help you.\" The voice belonged to a little magical creature who appeared out of nowhere. The creature told Cinderella that he could help her attend the party. He said all she had to do was wear a nice dress and find a carriage to ride to the party.\n",
      "So Cinderella asked her mother if she could have a dress. Her mother said yes, and soon Cinderella was wearing a beautiful blue dress. But then came the next problem - how did she get to the palace? Suddenly, the magical creature showed up again and gave Cinderella a pumpkin. With one wave of his hand, the pumpkin turned into a shining carriage!\n",
      "When they arrived at the palace, everyone was amazed to see Cinderella. They thought she was so beautiful. Everyone wanted to dance with her and the magical creature joined in too. They danced until the clock struck midnight, which was the deadline for returning to Cinderella's home.\n",
      "The magical creature waved goodbye to Cinderella and flew away. Cinderella took off her dress and put on her old dress made of ash. As she was leaving, she noticed something special - a slipper lay on the floor near the carriage.\n",
      "Cinderella decided to keep the slipper and put it in her pocket. When she got home, she showed it to her mother. Together, they looked for someone who could fit into the slipper. After a while, they found a prince who could fit perfectly into the slippered foot. He was very happy to have found the perfect match.\n",
      "The prince invited Cinderella to the royal ball every week, where they danced together until the clock rang midnight. Cinderella never forgot about the magical creature who helped her get to the royal palace. She always thanked him for giving her a second chance.\n",

      "There was once a modern child named Timmy who loved to explore. One day he was walking around the library looking for something special when he found a hidden treasure in an old book. It was a map with lots of stars and markings! He knew this was something important, so he decided to keep it safe and tucked it away in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, Timmy came back to the library after school to take a closer look at the map. But when he got there, he noticed that someone had put a big, glittery sticker over one part of the map. It made him curious, but also excited. He couldn't wait to follow the clues on the map. \n",
      "\n",
      "Timmy walked through the library, taking his time to find every clue he could. He opened books and looked around, checking each spot carefully. Finally, he found the last clue - a note saying \"look up\" written in a small, delicate hand. He smiled and ran outside. \n",
      "\n",
      "He climbed up onto the roof of the library, which was quite a feat. As he got closer, he saw that the rooftop was covered in stars. They twinkled like diamonds and sparkled in the twilight sky. He felt so much wonder as he took it all in. Then he heard a voice from above: \"Thank you!\" Timmy looked up to see a tiny, sparkling star glowing from the top of the roof. She was wearing a pretty necklace, decorated with glitter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Timmys heart swelled with joy and he hugged her tight. \"You're welcome,\" he said kindly. \"I'm glad I could help.\" Together, they used gentle magic to make the star's wings shine brighter, until it glowed so brightly she was able to fly down and join the other stars in the night sky. She thanked them again, before disappearing into the dark. \n",
      "Timmy was filled with peace and pride. He knew he had done something amazing. He stepped off the roof, feeling content and sleepy. He waved goodbye to the stars as he walked away.\n",

      "The dragon was feeling very nervous as they walked up to the stage for the first time. The other animals were already performing on stage with lots of colorful lights and sound effects. The dragon's heart started to race, and they wished that they had practiced more before coming here.\n",
      "Suddenly, one of the other animals noticed the dragon looking around nervously. They went up to the dragon and said, \"Don't worry! We're all here to have fun and make some beautiful music together. You don't need to be perfect, just show us your talents!\" \n",
      "The dragon smiled at the kind animal and nodded. Then, the dragon began to sing along with the other animals' melody. It felt so good to hear themselves sing, and the dragon couldn't stop smiling. As the performance came to an end, the dragon saw how much everyone was enjoying their music. They realized that even though they had been so nervous, they had still managed to do a great job.\n",
      "After the performance, the dragon thanked the other animals for being so kind and supportive. They also thanked the ones who had come out to watch the music festival. Everyone clapped and cheered for the dragon, and the little dragon felt so happy. They had made some new friends and had a lot of fun.\n",
      "As the sun set behind the mountains, the dragon found a cozy spot to rest under a big tree. The other little dragons joined them there and told stories about their adventures at the festival. Everyone laughed and shared jokes until it was time to go back home. Before they left, the dragon looked back at the stage one last time and smiled.\n",
      "The next day, the dragon met up with their friends again and agreed to keep practicing together. They knew that with hard work and self-control, they could become even better performers. And every time they performed, they always remembered the joy of making music with their friends.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The project delivers what it set out to build: a small-model fairy-tale writer that can reliably produce readable, child-friendly stories from a structured prompt and then rank them with an external judge. The evaluation results show a clear pattern. The model’s original bedtime stories score better because they match the TinyStories-style training set: simple scenes, warm tone, straightforward conflict, and easy placement of required words. The classic fairy-tale retellings score lower because famous stories come with strict expectations—specific plot beats, escalating tension, and a satisfying payoff. When any of those beats are rushed, missing, or only name-dropped, the rubric and especially the soft-minimum power-mean score penalizes the output heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classic fairy tales were included on purpose as a stress test, even though the main goal is to generate original bedtime stories under specific constraints. Well-known stories provide a familiar ground truth structure: they have expected plot beats, recognizable tone, and clear endings. By asking the model to generate within those classic frameworks while still obeying required words and features, the project checks whether the system can handle tighter narrative structure and higher expectations—not just produce a cozy story.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison with sampled dataset stories reinforces theory that the system can generate good bedtime stories. The dataset can produce high scoring examples, but the fine-tuned model tends to generate closer to the dataset’s average voice, but less often reaching the strongest, most complete narratives. The most practical conclusion is that the system is already useful as a **bedtime story writer** tool, while classic fairy-tale retellings remain the hardest case.\n",
